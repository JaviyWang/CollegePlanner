	to include to make this more efficient than the Cuny First site now.

	5/10/17
	Today I am going to work on a dropdown menu for the different classes that the colleges offer.
	I'm currently adding courses and course numbers. I'm also looking for a way to add extra classes 
	depending on which college you got into.
	
	5/11/17
	Today Alan and I created a dynamic way of adding courses to colleges rather than hard coding everything 
	we will also add in a parameter so that depending on which college you select you are offered different courses.
	
	5/12/17
	Today my group and I will discuss what we have made so far and where we are going with this entire project.
	We got to databases to work, so i'm working in exel right now to make it easier to see what we are doing
	
	5/15/17
	Today I will be finishing off the excel spreadsheets so that we can import them into mySql server.
	
	5/16/17
	Today i'm changing the layout to the website because althought a dropdown menu is better
	front end wise, its just more efficient if we put input tags. 
	
	5/17/17
	Today I got my group to finish up all the excel files because the wamp servers are down as of now .
	Therefore, Alan and I will continue to work on the website.

	Alan and I worked on together.
	
	5/23/17
	Today Alan and I will work on the other two pages we need to complete our website. 
	I Also emailed the Cuny board to ask them about how they designed their website.
	
	5/24/17
	We are going to improve on the php page we just developed 
	but now i need to actually call hunter's computer science department
	to ask about how they use hunter's databases.
	
	5/25/17
	I was able to contact both hunter and the Cuny Center throught both email and the phone. However, we 
	weren't able to add anything substantial to our research project.
	I am going to try to do more reserch and if that doens't work out ill contact other cunys. 
	
	5/30/17
	We are waiting for Anthony and Max to finish up the databases so that we can link them so today
	is solely based on helping them.

	While Max and Anthony are still working on their databases and getting the server to connect 
	Alan and I started working on our powerpoint presentation.
	
	6/1/17
	Alan and I completed a random generator for the classes times for testing, we also
	created a collapsible window so you can see all of your classes without looking at
	your schedule. Now we are fixing the alignment problem and I already have an idea to 
	fix that.

	server side of the project. We also added a delete button to remove a class that you might not want or misclicked.
	
	6/6/17
	Today we are going to add a photo slideshow for all the colleges we have in our system 
	meaning if we wanted to select hunter a slideshow would appear to show hunter's campus,
	building, gym, etc.
